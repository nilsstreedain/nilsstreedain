### Who am I?
Hello, my name is Nils Streedain. I am a Maker/Student from Portland Oregon. I spend a lot of time working on open source projects from coding to [3D modeling](https://www.thingiverse.com/nilsstreedain). I am currently studying Computer Science with a focus on Cyber Security at Oregon State University.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on...
- 🧑🏻‍💻 My newest project is [misu](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/misu) (macOS Iconset Utility). Misu is a command line utility for creating, modifying & swapping application iconsets in macOS. (Still heavily under construction)
- ⭐️ One of my more popular projects is a [list of verified DoH/DoT DNS servers](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/Long-List-of-DNS-Servers). Validated by powerful scripts to find and verify DNS servers. I plan to post that work when it is ready.
- ☁️ One of my favorite projects I am working on right now is a [dockerized version of the Hak5 Cloud C2 server application](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/Cloud-C2-Docker). I enjoy running and maintaining various server applications in Docker and [Hak5](https://hak5.org)'s products are a great personal hobby of mine.
- 👨🏻‍🎨 I am constantly modeling various files for 3D printing, these are all published on my [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/nilsstreedain) and [PrusaPrinters](https://www.prusaprinters.org/social/1142-nilsstreedain/about) pages!
- And much more!
<!-- - 📜 I also enjoy publishing instructions for personal projects I've done to help others move more quickly down some of the paths I've followed. Some of my favorite include my [personal Raspberry-Pi Docker server setup](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/RPi-Docker-Server-Setup), and my [instructions for enabling macOS DAL plugins](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/macOS-DAL-Webcam-Workaround) (particularly helpful for using unsupported webcams on macOS). -->
