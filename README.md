### Who am I?
Hello, my name is Nils Streedain. I am a Maker/Student from Portland Oregon. I spend a lot of my free time working on open source projects from coding to [3D modeling](https://www.thingiverse.com/nilsstreedain). I am currently studying Computer Science with a focus on Cyber Security at Oregon State University.

### What I'm Working On
- One of my more popular projects is a [list of verified DoH/DoT DNS servers](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/Long-List-of-DNS-Servers). I have written several scripts to find and verify these servers and I plan to publish that work when it is ready.
- One of my favorite projects I am working on right now is a [dockerized version of the Hak5 Cloud C2 server application](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/Cloud-C2-Docker). I enjoy running and maintaining various server applications in Docker and [Hak5's](https://hak5.org) products are a great personal hobby of mine.
- I also enjoy publishing instructions for personal projects I've done to help others move more quickly down some of the paths I've followed. Some of my favorite include my [personal Raspberry-Pi Docker server setup](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/RPi-Docker-Server-Setup), and my [instructions for enabling macOS DAL plugins](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/macOS-DAL-Webcam-Workaround) (particularly helpful for using unsupported webcams on macOS).
- I am constantly working on designing/modeling various 3D files for 3D printing, these are all published on my [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/nilsstreedain) page!
- And much more!
