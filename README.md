### Who am I?
Hello, my name is Nils Streedain. I am a Maker/Student from Portland Oregon. I spend a lot of time working on open source projects from coding to [3D modeling](https://www.thingiverse.com/nilsstreedain). I am currently studying Computer Science with a focus on Cyber Security at Oregon State University.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on...
- 🧑🏻‍💻 My newest project is [duo-bypass](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/duo-bypass). duo-bypass is a [web](duo-bypass.com) & CLI tool used to generate valid HOTP codes using 3rd party and open source applications other than DUO Mobile for organizations using by DUO Security.
- ⭐️ One of my more popular projects is a [list of verified DoH/DoT DNS servers](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/Long-List-of-DNS-Servers). Validated by powerful scripts to find and verify DNS servers. I plan to post that work when it is ready.
- ☁️ One of my favorite projects I am working on is a [dockerized version of the Hak5 Cloud C2 server application](https://github.com/nilsstreedain/Cloud-C2-Docker). I enjoy running and maintaining various server applications in Docker and [Hak5](https://hak5.org)'s products are a great personal hobby of mine.
- 👨🏻‍🎨 I am constantly modeling various files for 3D printing, these are all published on my [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/nilsstreedain) and [Printables](https://www.printables.com/social/1142-nilsstreedain/about) pages!
- And much more!
